### What can you do?

Most of my experience is in the web stack; but, here’s a list (in decreasing order of familiarity) of everything I’ve ever worked with:

For school:
- Java – including FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, and EclEmma plugins
- C – C99 standard, with GCC compiler and GDB debugger
- Jenkins (continuous integration)


For research:
- Chrome Extensions – written with JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Flask – a Python framework for basic server stuff
- SQLite – a simple database system
- R – a math and statistics geared programming language, great for data analytics


Everything else:
- PHP and mySQL – they run this very blog with WordPress!
- Google Apps Script
- Visual Basic for Applications
- Visual Basic .NET
- TI-BASIC – used to program calculators!
- Django – another Python framework, also for basic server stuff
- Linux (specificially, Ubuntu and Red Hat)

###  What’s your tech setup?

I’m currently using a [Dell XPS 13 (Early 2015)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(2015)) running [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/) and the [KDE Plasma 5](https://www.kde.org/) desktop environment. My preferred general-purpose text editor is [Atom](https://atom.io/), and I currently use [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) for Java development.
