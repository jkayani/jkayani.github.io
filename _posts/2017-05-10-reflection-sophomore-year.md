This past year, I've done quite a bit! By finishing my sophomore year at NC State, I've cleared most of the introductory/required computer science classes including:

- CSC 316: Data Structures and Algorithms
- CSC 230: C and Software Tools
- CSC 236: Computer Organization and Assembly Language
- CSC 246: Concepts and Facilties of Operating Systems
- CSC 333: Automata, Grammars, and Computability

I definitely enjoyed all of these, especially CSC 236, 246, and 333 (all taken this past semester); with Assembly Language and Operating Systems, the whole magic behind why/how a computer works is unveiled, and it answered a lot of the questions I had about the details of turning `public static void main (String args []) {}` into machine code. Automata was one of the best, but hardest, classes I've ever taken at NC State - the course focused on the different classes of finite automata and languages, and the theory of computation. It was pretty proof-based, and I got a lot more out of it mathematically than the class I took for my math minor, MA 341: Applied Differential Equations - it's too bad it doesn't count towards it.

As a result of all of this, I'm now familiar/proficient in MASM (Microsoft Assembler for 16-bit DOS), C (C99 standard), and LaTeX!

In terms of required classes, all that's left for me to take are:

- CSC 326: Software Engineering
- CSC 379: Ethics in Computing
- CSC 492: Senior Design

Additionally, I became an officer in NC State's [ACM/AITP (Association of Computing Machinery/Association of Information Technology Professionals)](https://acm-ncsu.github.io) organization - I help organize tech talks, workshops, our annual Pig Pickin' tradition, and run the website.

Also, I'll be serving the department as a [Computer Science ambassador](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/ambassadors/) - we basically help market the department to prospective students, and serve as a point of contact for people with questions about us.  

Finally, I've accepted an offer to serve as a Software Engineering Intern at [Dude Solutions](https://www.dudesolutions.com). They're a SaaS provider, and I'll be working on the backend of some of their operations management software - mostly C# and SQL Server.

I'm pretty excited for what's in store, and to jump into electives! Here's to the future!
