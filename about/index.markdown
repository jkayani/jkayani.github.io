### Who are you?

In case you missed it (it’s on the right side of the page), my name is Josh Kayani. I’m an aspiring undergrad, currently studying Computer Science at [North Carolina State University](http://ncsu.edu), in Raleigh, NC. Go Pack!

### What can you do?

Most of my experience is in the web stack; but, here’s a list
(in decreasing order of familiarity) of everything I’ve ever worked with:

For school:

* Java - including FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, and EclEmma plugins
* C - C99 standard, with GCC compiler and GDB debugger
* Jenkins (continuous integration)


For research:

* Chrome Extensions - written with JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* Flask - a Python framework for basic server stuff
* SQLite - a simple database system
* R - a math and statistics geared programming language,
great for data analytics


Everything else:

* Google Apps Script
* Visual Basic for Applications
* Visual Basic .NET
* Jekyll and Github Pages
* TI-BASIC - used to program calculators!
* PHP and mySQL - they ~~run~~ *used to run* this very blog with WordPress!
* Django - another Python framework, also for basic server stuff
* Linux (specificially, Ubuntu and Red Hat)

###  What’s your tech setup?

I’m currently using a [Dell XPS 13 (Early 2015)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(2015)) running [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/) and the [KDE Plasma 5](https://www.kde.org/) desktop environment. My preferred general-purpose text editor is [Atom](https://atom.io/), and I currently use [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
for Java development.

This site used to be powered by Jekyll, and [then switched to WordPress]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-12-21-migrating-from-jekyll-to-wordpress %}),
and is [now back to Jekyll again]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-12-23-back-to-jekyll %}), but this time with the support of Github Pages!
