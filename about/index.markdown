### Who are you?

In case you missed it (it’s on the right side of the page), my name is Josh
Kayani. I’m an aspiring undergrad, currently studying Computer Science at
[North Carolina State University](http://csc.ncsu.edu), in Raleigh, NC. Go Pack!

I also serve as an officer in [NC State's ACM/AITP chapter](https://acm-ncsu.github.io/) -
my main job is to manage our website, and otherwise help with club
administration.

### Are you looking for internship/job opportunities?

For Summer 2017, I'll be a Software Engineering Intern at [Dude Solutions](https://www.dudesolutions.com) in Cary, NC. I'm still interested in opportunities for the future, and you can contact me via [email](mailto:josh@joshkayani.me) here, or find me online:

###  What’s your tech setup?

I’m currently using a [Dell XPS 13 (Early 2015)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(2015)) running [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) and the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window manager. My preferred general-purpose text editor is [Vim](http://vim.org), and I currently use [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
for Java development. I've also started writing $$\LaTeX$$ which I support
on my website with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), and write on my computer with [TeXStudio](http://www.texstudio.org/).

This site used to be powered by Jekyll, and [then switched to WordPress]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-12-21-migrating-from-jekyll-to-wordpress %}),
and is [now back to Jekyll again]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-12-23-back-to-jekyll %}), but this time with the support of Github Pages!
