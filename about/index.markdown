###  What’s your tech setup?

I’m currently using a [Dell XPS 13 (Early 2015)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_13_(2015)) running [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/) and the [KDE Plasma 5](https://www.kde.org/) desktop environment. My preferred general-purpose text editor is [Atom](https://atom.io/), and I currently use [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
for Java development.

This site used to be powered by Jekyll, and [then switched to WordPress]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-12-21-migrating-from-jekyll-to-wordpress %}),
and is [now back to Jekyll again]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-12-23-back-to-jekyll %}), but this time with the support of Github Pages!
